## Knutebook 2017: “20 years of telling stories”

Once Upon a Time …

Twenty years is a very long time. Long enough for legends to be created. Stories are told and retold and grow with each telling. The very act of telling a story goes in and out of fashion. Some believe that it has no place in larp, others that the whole point of larp is to make every single character the protagonist. This year we would like to sit down in a comfortable chair and have a word with ourselves about stories.

### Concept:

The 2017 Knutepunkt book will look primarily at stories in larp. We’d like to interrogate the process of writing larps. We’d like to understand whether narrative is a dirty word. We want to investigate how larp storytelling can be translated into a political act. We want to look at how we tell stories in larp, how we write them, play them, steer them, shape them and report them. And we want to know what we might do with all of this in the future.

### The book will contain three sections:

Yesterday – larps that have been run and techniques we have used in the past; looking back over 20 years of KP and 30+ years of larp
Today – analysis of contemporary methods, cutting edge meta-techniques, really awesome games
Tomorrow – possible futures, new ideas, wild-eyed dreaming
We are looking for a multitude of texts for the different sections, both theoretical and practical, opinion pieces with rebuttals, even tidbits, anecdotes and small verses connected to character stories.

You do not have to be an academic, a writer nor an experienced larper to contribute. We encourage everyone who has an idea to contact us; we would love to hear from you.

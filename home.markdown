Welcome to Knutepunkt!

Knutepunkt is a conference about Nordic larp where we explore how experiences are created through different forms of larp design.

Larp designers, players, and designers from other fields interested in how the larp can be used, are very welcome to participate and contribute to the program.

The event is helt at Mastemyr Quality hotel just outside Oslo on February 23-26. The first round of tickets (Professional and Crowdfunding) will be released on July 1st 2016 at 4pm CET, and the sign-up for Regular and Subsidized tickets is open from September 23rd to September 30th 2016.

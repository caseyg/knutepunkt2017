## Knutebook 2017: 20 years of playing stories

Once Upon a Nordic larpâ€¦

Twenty years is a very long time. Long enough for legends to be created. Stories are told and retold and grow with each telling. The very act of telling a story goes in and out of fashion. Some believe that it has no place in larp, others that the whole point of larp is to make every single character the protagonist. 

This year we would like to sit down in a comfortable chair and have a word with ourselves about the stories of yesterday, the present, and the future.

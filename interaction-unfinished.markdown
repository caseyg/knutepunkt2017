##Program

The Dinner Party

“Parmiddagen (The Dinner Party) was a six episode drama broadcast by Sveriges Radio. And a larp. Online listeners could download a script with the same starting point and the same characters. And then create their own story. The radio show was created with inspiration from larp-methods. 

Anna-Karin Linder will tell the story of how the process behind the writing and how the show came to be.”

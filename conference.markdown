Knutepunkt is an international conference about larp and larp design held in Norway on February 23-26. 2017 just outside of Oslo. The conference is a participatory meeting place for larp designers and players who want to learn from and contribute to the ongoing Nordic larp discourse.

Knutepunkt was first organized in Norway in 1997, and celebrates it’s 20th anniversary in 2017. The Knutepunkt scene has been a driving force in establishing and developing the identity of larp in the Nordic countries and in establisning the term “Nordic larp” to describe the progressive approach to larp that dominates the Nordic scene.

At Knutepunkt 2017 you can expect a program comprised of old thoughts meeting new ideas in larp theory and design. Our program group will curate a program to help spike interesting thoughts, good discussions, and create the right environment for inspiration. However, Knutepunkt is very much a space created by those who participate. Not only do we rely on you for interesting program items, we also expect the participants to embrace the spirit of co-creation and participation in creating an open space fostering creativity.

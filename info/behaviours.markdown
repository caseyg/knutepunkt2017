It’s not always easy being in a new place, or meeting a lot of new people at once. To make it a little easier for everyone, we have listed some suggestions for things you can do to help each other out having a good time at Knutepunkt.

Please **speak English** during Knutepunkt, even though it can be tempting to speak your native language with people you know from your own community. English is helping foreigners to jump in and join the conversation. Try to **introduce people** to each other, to help everyone feel welcome and connected. **Welcoming newcomers** in a conversation and bringing them up to speed on the topics raised, also makes it easier for them to contribute in the discussion.

We encourage you to have an **open chair** at the table, or an open space in a circle of people talking, for people who would like to join the conversation. Seeing that a chair is available signals that the discussion is open, and that you are encouraging others to join in.

Please **assume the best** when it comes to the other participants, and try to **cut each other some slack**. Not everyone comes from the same shared knowledge base or social framework – use social slips or miscommunications as an opportunity to clarify, or to share knowledge in a respectful way! Please **be respectful** towards others. Be considerate with what you say, and bear in mind the perspectives of the listeners.

**The infodesk** at Knutepunkt will be staffed between 09:00 and 21:00 every day, so if you have a question, you are more than welcome to contact any of the organizers staffing the infodesk. They are there for your convenience, all will help you to the best of their abilities!

**When in disagreement, try to listen to the other party.** Misunderstandings and mistakes are unavoidable, but luckily we can correct them if we listen to each other – and please **ask questions**. If you don’t know about the specific concepts or haven’t heard about the specific larps that are discussed; please ask about it. Most people will be happy to explain!

Please **pay attention to the personal boundaries of the people you are interacting with**, and listen to what they are telling you. Remember that yes means yes, no means no, and “maybe some other time” also means no. When in doubt, asking is a good idea. Please take no for an answer (this goes for everything from intimate encounters to simple social requests). Always accept if a person wishes to leave a place or a situation.

We trust that everyone participating at Knutepunkt care for each other, and do not generally seek to harm others. If you are told that your words or actions feel like harassment, or is making someone unsafe, please **consider changing your behaviour**.

When telling somebody that you would like them to change behaviour, try to be specific and clear. We know that this isn’t always easy, but **clear communication will make it easier** for both parties. If someone tells you they would rather not like your attention, it means just that. **Respect it** and go somewhere else, **don’t take it personal**. It can be hard both to give and receive such a message, but it is essential for calibrating the interaction and making sure everyone has a good event.

**The organizers are grateful to everyone who helps making Knutepunkt a safe event by giving and taking messages in a good manner.**

**If you are feeling unsafe or harassed**, it is usually best to work it out involved parties, even though this is often uncomfortable. If you are unable to do this, or if somebody does not leave you alone even after being asked to do so, we encourage you to leave the situation, and to seek out help from the organizers’ contact points for safety issues (please see below).

//Knutepunkt is a place where we come to meet, explore, create and discuss; where we want to be dead serious and crazy creative at the same time. It is a diverse melting pot, where people of (almost) all ages meet with others with different larp interests and traditions, identities, ethnicities, sexualities, and religious/political beliefs and backgrounds –– and where every community has its own cultures and social expectations. We urge you to respect each others ideas, views and boundaries; to take care of, and encourage each other.//

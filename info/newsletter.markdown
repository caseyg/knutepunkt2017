Hello, dear Knutepunkt-travelers!

With less than a week to go (some of you might even have started your travels​ already!), here is some last-minute information concerning the next few days.

**How do I get to the venue?** (or: How do I get places during Week-In and Knutepunkt?)
* Download the app “Ruter billett” (“Ruter ticket”), and buy your tickets for public transport there. This is the cheapest and most convenient way to buy bus tickets.
* Read about the different ways to get to the hotel on our [webpage](http://knutepunkt.org/week/getting-around-in-oslo/)!
* If you are going to Knutepunkt from Oslo Central Station, [this is how you get to the bus stop Tollboden](https://www.google.no/maps/dir/Oslo+Central+Station,+Jernbanetorget+1,+154+Oslo/Tollboden,+Oslo/@59.9100382,10.7480467,17z/data=!4m13!4m12!1m5!1m1!1s0x46416e8a1c253d39:0x6d69efbe96e850d2!2m2!1d10.7524574!2d59.911096!1m5!1m1!1s0x46416e8a2eae0f63:0x9605dd0231ddecfd!2m2!1d10.7500315!2d59.9093666?hl=en) (where you’ll find both bus 83 and 80E).


**Food during Knutepunkt**
All food served during Knutepunkt will be vegetarian. If you are vegan, or if you have any food allergies, please **fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSds9gVJNOUolJYQ4UTDwsWCJfs0EKYlZfg8N-7fYo7_r7dSfg/viewform?c=0&w=1) by 12:00 (mid-day) Monday 20th**. All meals will be buffets, and we will make sure that the food content is clearly marked during the conference.

**When can I check in?**
Check-in will be open from 13:00 to 17:00, and most of you will get your rooms by then, although we can’t guarantee that all the rooms will be ready. A complementary lunch is served at the hotel, from 13:30 to 16:00. Because we do expect quite a lot of queuing, we strongly encourage you to try getting to the venue during lunch hour. That way, you’re also more likely to get a seat on the bus (as the rush hour starts around 16:00).

**I’m looking for information about A Week In Oslo and all the things that will happen during the days before Knutepunkt?**
Look no further! The program for AWiN can be found [here](http://knutepunkt.org/week/program/), and we have more detailed information on Interaction | Unfinished [here](http://knutepunkt.org/week/interaction-unfinished/). If you join our [Facebook-group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/610809782453145/?fref=ts), you will receive all the available information about what goes on, when, and where. The Week-In-staff have also made a document with some [practical information about Oslo](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ePBUk9zMqvz2kE6sCnCsztzo4pEAQk68EEG17VPYLg0/edit), that might be relevant to some of you.

**Is it freezing cold in Norway?**
Right now, it is somewhere between -5 to 5 degrees Celsius most days. If you are planning on taking walks around Oslo during Week-In, or exploring the forest and general area around Mastemyr hotel, we recommend that you bring warm clothes and shoes that can deal with walking in snow. [The weather might of course change in a week](https://weather.com/no-NO/weather/tenday/l/NOXX1697:1:NO), but at the moment (at Mastemyr) we have a couple of centimetres of snow on the ground and cold wind.

**What do I need to pack?**
* Pack the clothes you want to wear during AWiN and/or Knutepunkt. If you want to walk around in something else than heavy winter shoes, please remember to bring lighter/more comfortable footwear. You are of course free to bring indoor shoes/woollen socks, but we cannot guarantee that the floors in the common areas won’t be dirty. If you want to dress up during the [party](http://knutepunkt.org/conference/time-labyrinth/), don’t forget your costume!
* If you want to work out during Knutepunkt, the hotel has a deal with a nearby gym, about 10 minutes walk from the hotel, which guests can use free for charge (ask for a key and a map in the reception if you want to use it). If this applies to you, bring some work-out clothes as well! 


**Is there something I don’t need to pack?** The hotel will provide you with towels, soap/shampoo, bed linen, etc.

**Also, when packing, remember: The Totem of Knutepunkt!**
We need you to bring a small relic from a previous Knutepunkt, that you would like to sacrifice to the great gods of larp. Please remember that you will not be able to get it back again! Ideas for what to bring: A button from Solmukohta, a picture from Knudepunkt Denmark 2011, your nametag from 1999, a program from a past KP, or maybe that dried up lipstick from that one hour room party.

**Boardgaming area**
We are happy to inform you that there will be a small boardgaming area at Knutepunkt, where we will have a few tables, some couches, and boardgames. If any of you would like to bring some games that people could borrow and play, please do! Remember to clearly mark them with your name. :)

If you have other questions, read more on our [online Q&A](http://knutepunkt.org/conference/q-and-a/).

We are so excited to see you soon!

All the love,

The Knutepunkt organizers

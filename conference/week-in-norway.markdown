The official Week-In program begins on monday February 20. In addition there will be possibilities for socializing in the weekend of 17-19. For those interested in taking part in something coordinated in this period, please contact Jørn at slemdal@gmail.com

The following program is only the events one can take part in each day. We will also offer a hangout for those who want to simply be around and socialize, with basic amenities to allow for simple cooking.

In addition we will make a menu of optional side activities. Some of these might cost money, but there will always be something to do for free as well.

Here are some of the things you can experience during A Week in Norway:

**Monday 20. Theme: LARP and storytelling.**
A day filled with debates, workshops, and at least one LARP.

**Tuesday 21. Theme: LARP as a tool for teaching, telling, and learning.**
A professionally-focused conference for those with a special interest in larp as a tool for learning.

**Wednesday 22. Theme: LARP and literature.**
At Oslo’s main library, there will be a children’s LARP in daytime. In the evening there will be the Nordic Larp Talks, followed by a launch party for the Knutepunkt book.

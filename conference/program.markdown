      host: 'Jim Thompson, Drew Hart-Shea, Emmylou Laird'
      pitch: 'Long established larp organisers very much from the UK tradition of larp, are beginning to explore their own practice as game makers and organisers in an academic and reflective sense. Having recently organised and run a hard Sci Fi larp (CONTACT) they attempted to blend some of their experiences and ideas from UK larp with ideas and concepts from Nordic larp. The event was successful and inspired them to do more. The talk, and possible discussion, will be about aspirations and experiences of mixing approaches, lessons learnt and approaches to design.'

      title: 'Aesthetic larping'
      format: Talk
      host: 'Jeppe Bergmann Hamming, Maria Bergmann Hamming'
      pitch: 'We want to move larp and larp-design beyond the idioms of narrativism, immersion, gamism and "playing to lose". We propose an alternative way to view the experience of larping, both as a designer and participant, what we call aesthetic larping. In this talk we will argue that larp’s unique position as an art form is to be found in its ability to create a special form of aesthetic and authentic experiences, and present our basic framework for this way of larping.'

      title: 'Physical action: some practical tools'
      format: Workshop
      host: 'Jamie Harper'
      pitch: 'In almost every single larp, communication and narrative are developed primarily through physical action and, in recent years, non-verbal larps have become increasingly prevalent. So, if we''re larping with our bodies, what tools can we use to use our bodies more fully? This workshop will attempt to offer a couple of answers. Using some very simple methods from actor training, including Laban Working Actions and Psychological Gesture, I will offer some tools that designers/facilitators can use to help players get closer to the emotional and imaginative life of their character/role through physical action.'

      format: Workshop
      host: 'Mila Ould Yahoui, Mo Holkar, Sarah Lynne Bowman, Harrison Greene'
      pitch: 'The use of alcohol at larp events is a controversial subject. Some participants firmly believe that alcohol enhances their experience by increasing the party mood, reducing social anxiety and inhibition, whereas others have experienced negative repercussions, such as harassment, mood swings, and hangovers. This workshop is open to people from all perspectives of the issue. Sharing data from an unofficial survey piloted in January that garnered over 1000 responses, we will discuss some of the pros and cons of drinking at larp events. We will also offer suggestions for people who wish to stay sober and organizers who wish to run sober events.'

Feel free to coordinate on beforehand at jannick@raunow.dk or +4529722786. However, the only strict requirement is an open mind and a playful spirit.'

      format: Talk
      host: 'Lizzie Stark, Tor Kjetil Edland'
      pitch: 'A larp is a social agreement among players and organizers.

Drawing from their combined decades of organizing experience, Tor Kjetil and Lizzie will talk about the places of uncertainty within this social agreement, including when it''s OK to refuse a player service, to what extent organizers must provide an environment that is a safe haven from oppressive structures prevalent in society, strategies for helping players care for one another, and other hot-button topics.'

      pitch: 'Not had time to read the Knutebook yet, but still want to know what the hot topics are? We have TWO sessions of lightning talks that will give you the highlights directly from our writers! A lightning talk is a flash of inspiration in five minutes; a hint of an idea; a pitch from one of the writers which introduces their article or their topic. It is like a twenty course tasting menu of contemporary nordic larp. There may be time for a few questions after each talk, if not you’ll know who to talk to later!'

And how can theories and knowledge of multimodality aid Larp designers in matters such as generating engagement through efficient communicative strategies and the design of space?'

      pitch: 'Youth work, especially in Scandinavian countries, concentrates on enabling and facilitating young people in social and civic activity, offers non-formal and experiential learning possibilities, and introduces social empowerment via different hobbies and activities, among other things. Larp possesses considerable potential in youth work - sharing key elements with other experiential learning methods, such as adventure education and drama education. Implemented in youth work, though, it can differ quite a bit from school-oriented edu-larping. Here we share some insights, experiences and research concerning non-formal educational use of larp in youth work.'

How would you choose? The known threat or the unknown salvation? Participants are invited to an extended, additional but voluntary debriefing afterwards.'

Sound is evocative, it puts us in our world, establishing relationships with others and with the environment. Despite that, many larp designers don’t work with sound, but rather put their effort into the visual aspect. In this talk we analyze how sound and listening can be used to improve larp design, through case studies, sound examples and a brief overview of audio softwares and devices. Be ready for an interactive talk - don’t be quiet!'

Iva describes some of the more interesting design challenges and specifications that this design process entailed: Creating a unique storyline for each character, in which they are the main protagonist of their own novel; how in this scripted design they incorporated player-individualization; and how they asked the players to work with the dramatic progression.'

The talk includes in-game design for inclusivity, which discusses character writing and world-building for the representation of identities, and off-game design for inclusivity, which includes community norms and player conduct expectations to create play spaces that feel safer for players of color, and people of all genders and sexualities.'

There are many layers of psychology explaining this need for digging in such dark past, but one of the reasons may be the urge for showing people what we have to fight for. Anita shares her experience of making grave, historical larps, and Anna-Karin Linder shares her perspectives from the larp Brudpris.'

      host: 'Maury Brown, Sarah Lynne Bowman, Johanna Koljonen'
      pitch: 'Players are unique individuals with varying experience, abilities, triggers, and comfort zones – physical and emotional. How do you ensure that players feel safe and able to consent to roleplay they desire and opt-out of what they don’t? What to do if a boundary gets crossed, or a player becomes triggered or overwhelmed? Safety and calibration mechanics are tools designed to help players feel comfortable with each other and their own needs and boundaries during a game. We will introduce and model the system of mechanics designed for New World Magischola, some of which were used at End of the Line, Convention of Thorns, and are being added to other larps.'

This is a talk about experiences and practices of using meta room in larp design with examples from recent Finnish larps Homefront and Marras where it has been a key design tool when exploring the themes of war, loss and survival. The aim is to share ideas about the possibilities of meta room and to help larp designers tackle some common design challenges.'

      pitch: 'The queen, the judge, the overseer, the principal, the spymaster, the emperor, and the many other faces of power. All of them are made real by the player''s capacity to plausibly portray the visage of dominance. By working with these techniques any player can challenge themselves and put more tools in their larp toolbox to have increase their options when it comes to what kind of characters they dare to play. In most larps this will also make it possible to facilitate scenes and moods that otherwise are hard to achieve. To some players this comes naturally, but there are also techniques that can be learned.'

      host: 'Alessandro Giovannucci'
      pitch: 'In recent years larp in Italy and Southern Europe has taken on new, more conscious forms. Nordic style was important in the development, but new and exciting approaches are blooming. A Dionysian spirit animates us - the corporeal, the non-functional, the non-regulated, the invasiveness, and the politically incorrect are our natural forms of expression. This has led to the creation of several larps and the Southern Way - New Italian Larp Manifesto. This talk will analyze the design in new Italian Larp by highlighting its narrative approach and structural aspects. Through case studies we provide a key to understand the specificity of the emerging new Italian larp scene.'

This half-talk, half-workshop delves into the patterns, numbers, and shapes that can make our designs more user-friendly to player brains. What''s the best use of short-term memory? How can we apply furniture placement to guide interaction outcomes? What mathematical differences distinguish a juicy social setup from one that falls flat? The habits of player cognition work like any other force of nature: when we build a game upon them, we can either strain and resist them, or work in harmony to enhance the quality of our creation.'

With inspiration from Brecht''s differentiation between immersion and reflection, we will discuss the why and the how of designing for meta-reflection during an ongoing larp. What are the motives for making players switch perspectives during an ongoing narrative? What examples of this can we find in our larps? What can we learn from other media?'

      format: Talk
      host: 'Jonaya Kemper'
      pitch: 'Do you like adventure? Do you like a challenge? Do you think you can lead 15 children through the fires of a volcano to discover a lost treasure? This fun hands-on workshop will go over some basic early childhood education principles and how we can use them to create age appropriate larp scenarios for very young children (3-5). We’ll learn how to extend solo play into co-operative make-believe, and allow children to make up their own stories with adults as the barest facilitators. At the end, participants will create short larp scenarios with teams and will lead all of us through them!'

      format: Talk
      host: 'Anders Berner, Claus Raasted, Sofie Støvelbæk'
      pitch: 'How do we train new organizers and introduce young people to larp? Simultaneously creating a national community of organizers while promote specific values? Research done by the The Happiness Research Institute suggests that active participation in the organization of larps greatly enhances self-esteem, recognition of hard and soft skills and the feeling of being valued as a person.  Our main method, Larp-in-a-box, is an easy way of training new organizers to successfully run their first larp, with everything they need being provided in a packed-and-ready box. This presentation deals with the methods and research results of an ongoing Danish project.'

      pitch: 'A very laidback talk. Tomas HV Mørkrid, a Norwegian gamesmith with more than twenty years of professional design in the field of verbal- and live role-playing games, will make a short introduction on the virtues of spontaneous interaction, how to design for it, and how to be a positive part of it. After the introduction he invites you to participate in a discourse on the theme. We will discuss the spontaneous nature of gameplay, real life dealings, love, family-relationships, and everyday life. And we may search for the magical meeting point between spontaneity and ritual.'

      host: 'Andrew Lacanienta'
      pitch: "Experiences are difficult to define because they are different for everyone.\_ One person might participate in a larp and have a transformative experience while another might experience no personal change or transformation at all.\_ Although both larp participants would say they had an experience, the\nperson who experienced a transformation of their way of thinking might say they were changed in a more meaningful way.\_ This presentation discusses the potential of transformative experiences and how co-creation and principles of experience staging might facilitate a larp experience that results in a paradigm change of participants’ views, life perceptions, and behaviors."

## 20 years of telling stories

KP2017 is the full circle 20th anniversary of Knutepunkt, and we are bringing the lovechild of larp all the way back where it started. We want to take the opportunity to glance back in the history of  Knutepunkt and Nordic larp to see what we have learned, what mistakes we made, and where we struck gold. We want to contemplate on the current situation and navigate through the landscape of ideas, events, trends and topics that we find ourselves in the middle of. And lastly, we want to look ahead and see where we might be heading in the future.

## Newcomers and old farts are setting agenda

We have a program of larps, workshops, panels, talks, rituals and good ideas, contributed by both the old and dusty and the young and bold. The program is both co-created by participants and curated by the program comittee to create a  a kick-ass anniversary program!

## Open space

There will also be an open space opportunity, for experimental concepts, playful meetings and on-the-spot-ideas. We encourage you to air your plans to [kp17openspace@gmail.com](mailto:kp17openspace@gmail.com) , but you can also sign up on the spot. Nothing is set in stone until each open space session starts.

Deadline was November 15th, but please, please, don’t wait until last minute. But, if you did, you an try your luck and **[submit your idea here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1ueqp3kgtp8Gx7Xp_kDxIcLCDKFBHeasU7cTW581iQJ4/viewform)**!

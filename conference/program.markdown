## 20 years of telling stories

KP2017 is the full circle 20th anniversary of Knutepunkt, and we are bringing the lovechild of larp all the way back where it started. We want to take the opportunity to glance back in the history of  Knutepunkt and Nordic larp to see what we have learned, what mistakes we made, and where we struck gold. We want to contemplate on the current situation and navigate through the landscape of ideas, events, trends and topics that we find ourselves in the middle of. And lastly, we want to look ahead and see where we might be heading in the future.

## Newcomers and old farts are setting agenda

We have a program of larps, workshops, panels, talks, rituals and good ideas, contributed by both the old and dusty and the young and bold. The program is both co-created by participants and curated by the program comittee to create a  a kick-ass anniversary program!

## Open space

There will also be an open space opportunity, for experimental concepts, playful meetings and on-the-spot-ideas. We encourage you to air your plans to [kp17openspace@gmail.com](mailto:kp17openspace@gmail.com) , but you can also sign up on the spot. Nothing is set in stone until each open space session starts.

Deadline was November 15th, but please, please, donâ€™t wait until last minute. But, if you did, you an try your luck and **[submit your idea here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1ueqp3kgtp8Gx7Xp_kDxIcLCDKFBHeasU7cTW581iQJ4/viewform)**!

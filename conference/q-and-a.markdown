## When?
February 23-26th 2017. Knutepunkt will begin on Thursday 23rd with check-in from 4pm and the opening ceremony at 5pm, and end with a closing ceremony at 1pm on Sunday 26th.

## Where?
Mastemyr Quality Hotel, just outside of Oslo, Norway. The adress is Lienga 11, 1410 Kolbotn. It is possible to contact the hotel to book extra nights, but we recommend that you consider staying closer to the city center if you plan on attending a Week in Norway.

## How to get there?
The local buses to the conference venue leaves from a bus stop within walking distance from the central station, and stops right outside the hotel. Bus 83 (towards Tårnåsen) usually leaves twice every hour, and the ticket is 52 kroner (please remember to bring cash, or to buy your ticket before getting on the bus).

If you arrive by car, there is a big, free parking space right outside the hotel. For those of you arriving to Oslo by plane, the easiest often cheapest option will be to fly to Oslo Airport Gardermoen. From there you can take the local or airport express train to Oslo central station.

## How do I get a ticket?
[You need to buy a ticket. ](http://knutepunkt.siteleaf.net/conference/tickets-and-payment/)We offered subsidized tickets for people with lower income/students in the first round of ticket sales, and we unfortunately cannot offer any scholarships outside of this. Ticket sales will close on January 20th.

## What will my ticket include?
Your ticket will include the conference including all program items, a sleeping space according to your choices, breakfast, lunch and dinner every day, and coffee and tea. We recommend most of our participants to stay at the conference hotel to get the full Knutepunkt experience, but it is possible to buy tickets without on-site accomodation.

## How will the sleeping arrangements be?
We will invite you to send requests for roommates in a window from January 20th to January 25th. We will do our best to grant your requests, but can’t make any guarantees. If you want to make sure you get the roommate you want, please consider a room upgrade.

## Is there an age limit?
Yes. You have to be at least 18 years old to participate at Knutepunkt. No exceptions, no chaperones, not even if your parents are going.

We will allow for parents to bring very young children/babies. Please contact us to make practical arrangements for this when the ticket sales open if you are planning on bringing a child.

## What can I do, if I arrive in Oslo before Knutepunkt starts?
You can join A Week-In Norway! Three days with free and curated program for you to enjoy, explore Oslo and socialize with other Knutepunkt-goers.

## How can I contribute to the conference?
The call for program and the call for articles are both closed. The best way to contribute, is to bring an open mind and whole heartedly participate in the Knutepunkt experience as it goes along. 

## Can I volunteer?
The conference itself is not currently searching for volunteers.

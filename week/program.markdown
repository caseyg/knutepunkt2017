**12:00** – The hangout opens at Kampen Bydelshus.


**17:00** – Larp: Screwing the crew (queer edition).
Organizers: Trine Lise Lindahl, Elin Nilsen and Tor Kjetil Edland

“Screwing the crew is a larp about an open-minded group of friends. They go way back, and a lot of them have been in relationships. Open relationships are the norm rather than monogamous ones. This is the story of the friends today, with flashbacks played out during the larp to give a backstory.

The larp has been run several times before across the world, but this time there’s a twist: For Week-In there will be two runs, one for female-identifying players, and one for male. What happens when a queer circle of friends meet for a dinner party and old rivalries and love rekindles?”

[Sign-up](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSekSH2G9MdxzMSLIYs2tQICYAhrKNe5P0GFZbIrdKLagejKQw/viewform) for all female run.

[Sign-up](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeiMmIlMcZNOjnOee3fI2BVZ-FopLw5ES4ly2rVcngYQqTBcg/viewform) for all male run.

**19:00** – Larp café at Kampen Bydelshus! There will be talks, entertainment, and general socializing.



## Program: Tuesday 21st


**09:00** – Edularp conference at Furuset bibliotek & aktivitetshus
(sign-up coming!) NOTE: This is mostly for those of you who work in professions where larp might be a useful tool. There will be an alternate social program based out of Kampen Bydelshus at the same time.


**15:00** – Larp: In Residency
Organizer: Lizzie Stark

“In Residency is a short, live action [American Freeform](http://leavingmundania.com/2013/11/18/introducing-american-freeform/) game for 10-16 players about the relationship between trauma and art, and about the weird atmosphere of artists’ colonies, where intensely personal daily work rubs up against a claustrophobic cocktail-party environment at night. Brython: it’s where we’re all alone together.

For residents at this elite artists’ colony, Brython represents the chance to live full time as their most secret selves, ignoring everything but their sacred drive to elevate the soul through art. By day, they make art in the beautiful surroundings of a fully staffed mansion, transforming their dark pasts into beauty. By night, they live in a fishbowl of observation and unresolved sexual tension. Will they overcome impostor syndrome to work on the projects they said they would? Will their off-colony relationship survive? Or will it all degenerate into Bacchanalia?”

## Program: Wednesday 22nd

**10:00** (and onwards) – Hangout at Kampen Bydelshus.


**12:00** – Larp: Playing the Cards (Skam edition!) [Event page](https://www.facebook.com/events/923617007774135/)

“Play the Cards is a larp about being a teenager, about fitting in, and about knowing your place in the hierarchy. You’re in high school; you know who you are, what your social position is and, most importantly, who you want to be. This is your first real house party. No parents. It’s the important party where everyone shows up and anything might happen.

The gist of this larp is to give the players the opportunity to re-live both the good and bad feelings of their teen years, to see the situation from different perspectives and most of all: to remember when emotions and the small events of everyday teen life were the most important things in the whole wide world.

[Skam!](http://skam.p3.no/) The playstyle will be based on what is seen in the Norwegian TV-series. If you haven’t watched it, don’t despair – there will be a workshop beforehand. Some characters will be merged with persons from the show, and there will be plenty of opportunity for SMS-gaming.”

**13:00-16:00** - Playing with methods
Deichmanske Library, Grünerløkka

Playing with methods is a collaborative method for testing ideas, exercises or mechanics. The basic premiss is that we don't discuss ideas, we try them out and then evaluate. Everyone can bring ideas to be tested and everyone are free to elaborate on or taking the ideas in new directions. The event will be facilitated by Nina Runa Essendrop.

**18:00**
Kampen Bydelshus closes! The Oslo public library is where we'll gather everyone. (See below).

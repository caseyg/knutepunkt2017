## PUBLIC TRANSPORT IN AND AROUND OSLO

Oslo has a public transit system of trains, buses, trams and metro. Oslo Airport and Mastemyr Hotell is outside Oslo's municipal borders, so tickets to/from these places are more expensive but can be bought in the same ticket system.

Here is some guidance on how to get around as cheaply as possible. 

We strongly recommend to download the "Ruter billett" (Ruter ticket) app for your smartphone and buy your tickets there. This is the cheapest and most convenient way to buy tickets.

## GOING DIRECTLY FROM THE AIRPORT TO KP

If you are going directly fro Oslo Airport Gardermoen to Mastemyr Hotel, you can buy a ticket for a local train to Oslo valid for transfer to the bus to Mastemyr. It will cost you NOK 112. The ticket is valid for 3 hours, so a short stop in central Oslo is possible.

## STAYING IN OSLO FOR THE WEEK

If you are staying a couple of days in Oslo, you most likely would like a to buy a weekly pass for Oslo. It costs NOK 240 (NOK 120 if you are under 20 years old). If you take at least 8 trips including trips to/from the airport and to/from Mastemyr Hotell, you will save money buying this card.

This pass allows for unlimited travel in Oslo and gives discounts on tickets to/from Oslo Airport and to/from Mastemyr Hotel.

Buy the weekly pass for Oslo before you get on the train from the airport to the city. That way, you can buy an "add-on" ticket for NOK 60 instead of a regular ticket for NOK 92. NB! Valid on local NSB trains only.

## GETTING AROUND WITHOUT THE WEEKLY PASS

If you are not buying the weekly pass, these are the prices for single tickets:

Local train between Oslo and Oslo Airport (valid for transfer in Oslo): 92 NOK 

Airport express train between Oslo and Oslo Airport (no transfer allowed): 180 NOK (Students under 31 years old NOK 90) 

Local ticket in Oslo: NOK 32

Local ticket between Oslo and Mastemyr Hotell: NOK 52

## GETTING FROM OSLO TO THE KP HOTEL

Mastemyr hotel is outside the city borders. It can be reached by Bus 83 that departs form Tollboden close to the Central Station.

A single ticket to Mastemyr Hotell costs NOK 52.

If you have a valid weekly pass for Oslo, a add-on ticket to Mastemyr Hotell costs NOK 20.

If you want to save som money, you can also take the slower bus 80E to Åsbråten. The hotel is a 7 minute walk from here, and you have to walk on a small trail through a forest, so this option is not recommended if there is heavy snow, if you have lots of luggage or if you have trouble walking on small trails.

A ticket costs NOK 32 with the 80E bus. This bus is free of charge if you have a weekly pass for Oslo.

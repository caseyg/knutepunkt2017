## Program

**The Dinner Party**

“Parmiddagen (The Dinner Party) was a six episode drama broadcast by Sveriges Radio. And a larp. Online listeners could download a script with the same starting point and the same characters. And then create their own story. The radio show was created with inspiration from larp-methods. 

Anna-Karin Linder will tell the story of how the process behind the writing and how the show came to be.”


**Larping into a museum**

“In January 2017 the Finnish Museum of Games opened. Unlike most game museums around the world, this does not include just digital games, but also board games, card games, even role-playing games. Indeed, it is the first one to include even larp in its collection.

Listen to Jakko Stenros telling the story and philosophy behind the newly opened museum.”

**Open movement concert**

“A movement experiment stretching over artforms where we celebrate human expressions through improvisation. 

Musician Lo Ersare (SWE) gives a workshop with vocal electronic improvisations where the audience react to the music through movement and body contact. 

In the evening on February 20, the resonance in Lo's music becomes electrical synapses, that control the nervous system and overtakes the physical body.”

**The lowland clearances**

"Jamie Harper is a theatre director, acting teacher and drama researcher based in London. He trained as a theatre director at LAMDA and is a previous winner of the JMK Directors' Award and the National Theatre Cohen Bursary. 

Early 2016 Jamie Harper presented a larp at Camden People's Theatre in London. The Lowland Clearances was about the changing landscape of the city and the political games that continue to shape it. 

The landscape of theatre is political, with the 'fourth wall' supposedly separating the spaces of artists and spectators, but larp does things differently. 

And theatre has shown itself to be open to larp.” 

**The universe is a small hat**

César Alvarez is a New York-based composer, lyricist, and writer. His work focuses on the intersection of music, narrative and participatory media. César has written four full-length musicals, released four albums with his band The Lisps, and composed scores for contemporary dance, plays and film. He is also a Visiting Associate Professor at The University of the Arts in Philadelphia and the Artistic Director of Polyphone, a festival of the emerging musical at UArts.

The Universe is a Small Hat is a 100-player narrative game that tells the story of a space colony leaving earth to form a new society. In his talk César will discuss the experience of bringing nordic larp into his art practice, and what theater and nordic larp might have to learn from one another in this emerging moment."


**The Godess og the night**
Albin Werle is a visual artist and a member of the Nyxxx collective. He is currently doing his masters degree at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts. His work consists of formulating real and imaginary games in a variety of materials, ranging from ceramics and 3D-printing to choreography and conversations.

Nattens Gudinna (Goddess of the Night) is written to be performed in a traditional theatre institution. In their work, the art collective Nyxxx focus on utilizing non-hierarchical collaborations internally, and strive to invite the workers of the institution and the participants in the performance to take part in formulating its content.

Both Goddess of the Night and its precursor Tactical Meditations could be seen as collections of smaller games. Some of which will be showcased during the evening.”

##Program

The Dinner Party

“Parmiddagen (The Dinner Party) was a six episode drama broadcast by Sveriges Radio. And a larp. Online listeners could download a script with the same starting point and the same characters. And then create their own story. The radio show was created with inspiration from larp-methods. 

Anna-Karin Linder will tell the story of how the process behind the writing and how the show came to be.”


Larping into a museum

“In January 2017 the Finnish Museum of Games opened. Unlike most game museums around the world, this does not include just digital games, but also board games, card games, even role-playing games. Indeed, it is the first one to include even larp in its collection.

Listen to Jakko Stenros telling the story and philosophy behind the newly opened museum.”

Open movement concert

“A movement experiment stretching over artforms where we celebrate human expressions through improvisation. 

Musician Lo Ersare (SWE) gives a workshop with vocal electronic improvisations where the audience react to the music through movement and body contact. 

In the evening on February 20, the resonance in Lo's music becomes electrical synapses, that control the nervous system and overtakes the physical body.”

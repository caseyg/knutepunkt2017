Knutepunkt is an international conference about larp held in Norway on February 23-26. 2017 just outside of Oslo. The conference is a participatory meeting place for larp designers and players who want to learn from and contribute to the ongoing Nordic larp discourse.

Knutepunkt is a part of a Nordic tradition of larp conferences in the Nordic countries that include [Knudepunkt](http://www.knudepunkt.org/), [Knutpunkt](http://knutpunkt.org/) and [Solmukohta](http://www.solmukohta.org/).

Knutepunkt was first organized in Norway in 1997, and celebrates it’s 20th anniversary in 2017. The Knutepunkt scene has been a driving force in establishing and developing the identity of larp in the Nordic countries and in establisning the term “Nordic larp” to describe the progressive approach to larp that dominates the Nordic scene.

<p class="lead">Knutepunkt is an international conference about larp held in Norway on February 23-26. 2017 just outside of Oslo. The conference is a participatory meeting place for larp designers and players who want to learn from and contribute to the ongoing Nordic larp discourse.</p>

Knutepunkt is a part of a Nordic tradition of larp conferences in the Nordic countries that include [Knudepunkt](http://www.knudepunkt.org/), [Knutpunkt](http://knutpunkt.org/) and [Solmukohta](http://www.solmukohta.org/).

## Vision

KP2017 is the full circle 20th anniversary of our beloved Knutepunkt, all the way back where it started. We want to take the opportunity to glance back in the history of  Knutepunkt and Nordic larp to see what we have learned, what mistakes we made, and where we struck gold. We want to contemplate on the current situation and navigate through the landscape of ideas, events, trends and topics that we find ourselves in the middle of. And lastly, we want to look ahead and see where we might be heading in the future.

## History

Knutepunkt was first organized in Norway in 1997, and celebrates it’s 20th anniversary in 2017. The Knutepunkt scene has been a driving force in establishing and developing the identity of larp in the Nordic countries and in establisning the term “Nordic larp” to describe the progressive approach to larp that dominates the Nordic scene.
